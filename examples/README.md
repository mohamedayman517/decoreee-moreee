# Base64 Image Storage Implementation Examples in MongoDB

## Overview

This folder contains illustrative examples of how to implement Base64 image storage in MongoDB database for the "Decor And More" project. This approach ensures that images will be available to all team members regardless of the device they are working on.

## Available Files

1. **`base64_register_example.js`**: Example of implementing image conversion to Base64 in user registration route.
2. **`base64_project_with_compression.js`**: Example of implementing image conversion to Base64 with image compression in projects route.

## How to Use

These files are illustrative examples only and should not be used directly. Instead, they should be used as a reference to implement the required changes in the current project files.

### General Implementation Steps

1. **Install Required Libraries**:

   ```bash
   npm install sharp --save
   ```

   (Sharp library is optional but useful for image compression)

2. **Modify Route Files**:

   - Use the provided examples to modify the current route files in the project.
   - Ensure Base64 image conversion is implemented in all routes that handle image uploads.

3. **Modify Data Models**:

   - Ensure all data models use String type field to store images.

4. **Modify User Interface**:
   - Ensure all pages that display images use the field value directly in the `src` attribute.

## Important Notes

### Performance Optimization

- Use `sharp` library to compress images and reduce their size before converting to Base64.
- Set limits for allowed file upload sizes.
- Use file type validation to ensure users only upload images.

### Handling Large Images

- Avoid storing very large images as Base64 in the database.
- If dealing with large images, consider using GridFS or cloud storage services.
